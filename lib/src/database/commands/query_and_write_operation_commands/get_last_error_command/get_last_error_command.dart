/// getLastError command.
///
/// Changed in version 2.6: A new protocol for write operations integrates
///   write concerns with the write operations, eliminating the need for a
///   separate getLastError. Most write methods now return the status
///   of the write operation, including error information.
///   In previous versions, clients typically used the getLastError in
///   combination with a write operation to verify that the write succeeded.
///
/// Returns the error status of the preceding write operation on the
///   current connection.
///
/// The command accepts the following fields:
/// * db 	[Db]
///   - The database on which the previous write operation ha been executed.
/// * writeConcern WriteConcern
///   - When running with replication, this is the number of servers to
///     replicate to before returning. A w value of 1 indicates the primary
///     only. A w value of 2 includes the primary and at least one secondary,
///     etc. In place of a number, you may also set w to majority to indicate
///     that the command should wait until the latest write propagates to a
///     majority of the voting replica set members.
///     If using w, you should also use wtimeout. Specifying a value for
///     w without also providing a wtimeout may cause getLastError to block
///     indefinitely.
/// * getLastErrorOptions [GetLastErrorOptions] - Optional
///   - a set of optional values for the command
